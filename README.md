Welcome to Hangman Solver!

This is a small side project I started in order to learn python and try to create my own deep learning model. Of course, said model is going to be very basic, his single purpose is to solve hangman games.

Current version: v1.0.2

Roadmap:
  v1:
    .1:
      .1: Make a base python app
      .2: Make a playable hangman game
        .1: Add unit tests
      .3: Add word list and hangman wolrd randomizer
      .4: Make a game solving bot
      .5: Train the bot
      .6: Test the bot and take notes
    .2:
      .1: Test diffrent word lengths and max attempts
      .2: Take notes
    .3:
      .1: Add a word base for the bot. Check the % of word knowledge an avrege person and give the bot acces to the same % of the word base. The words will be picked randomly
      .2: Considder adding "braing fog". When humans solve hangman games, they dont think of all the words they know on the spot. The bot should have a system that makes some words less likly to bry considered than others. Maybe it should also uptade those chanhes according to past guesses.
      .3: Take notes

Patch notes:
  v1.1.2
    Start of the project. Just a playable hangman game as a basic python app. For now all the settings of the hangman game are hardcoded.
  v1.1.2.1
    Added tests for hangman. Changes app initialization, so firtly it executes tests, then If tests succed, the app will start. From now on unit tests should be added for each new developed module

Personal notes:
    Sorry for such a basic documentation, I prever coding than describing code. The project is small (at least for now, we'll see where this goes in the future) so this shouldn't be that big of a deal.
